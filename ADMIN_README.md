## Security Notes

### Production Deployment
1. **Change Default Credentials**: Update the admin username/password in `admin_login.php`
2. **Use Secure Passwords**: Implement proper password hashing
3. **Add IP Restrictions**: Consider restricting admin access to specific IPs
4. **Enable HTTPS**: Ensure admin pages are served over HTTPS
5. **Session Security**: Add session timeout and regeneration

### Code Security
- Admin authentication is session-based
- All admin pages check for `$_SESSION['admin_logged_in']`
- Firebase data access is read-only for admin functions

## Database Structure

The admin system reads from existing Firebase collections:
- `users` - User accounts
- `notes` - Sell notes
- `shared_notes` - Shared notes
- `rental_notes` - Rental notes
- `chats` - User conversations

## Navigation

- Admin login link appears in main navigation for non-logged-in users
- Admin panel link appears in navigation when admin is logged in
- Admin logout clears session and redirects to login

2. **File Deletion**: Add ability to remove inappropriate files
3. **Audit Logs**: Track admin actions
4. **Email Notifications**: Notify admins of new uploads
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter files by date, user, etc.
6. **Export Data**: Export user/file data to CSV
7. **Role-Based Access**: Multiple admin levels
